# House Price Prediction - Linear Regression
______________________________________________

In this project, we use  Linear Regression to predict the price of house based on area in square feet.               

Procedure:                                                                        
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                      
=> Collect dataset  house price with area , it has only one input(area) and one output(price).                                             
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.
=> Visualise dataset with graph plotted between area and price.                                                                      
=> Segregate the independant and dependant values.                                                                
=> Use Linear regression algorithm by finding m - slope and b- intercept, and equating in equation y = mx+b.                       
=> Training model for  dataset.                                                                    
=> Predicted the price(output).
